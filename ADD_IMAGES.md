# Adding Property Images

To complete the setup, please add these three images to the `/public/images/` directory:

## Required Images:

1. **building-exterior.jpg** - The main building exterior photo showing the "Office Space Available" sign
2. **building-frontage.jpg** - The frontage view showing units 530, B, C, D, E with Designer Maid and Southeastern Physical Therapy signage  
3. **property-details.jpg** - The property information document showing building facts, parking, and transportation details

## Steps:

1. Save the three images you provided to `/public/images/` with the exact filenames above
2. Run `npm run dev` to test locally
3. The gallery will automatically use these local images instead of the placeholder URLs

## Image Specifications:

- **Format**: JPG or PNG
- **Recommended size**: 1200x800px or similar aspect ratio
- **File size**: Keep under 2MB each for fast loading

Once images are added, the site will be ready for production deployment!
